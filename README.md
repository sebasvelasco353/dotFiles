# dotfiles
my dotfiles used to configure the basics of my dev Env

## Usage
- Clone this repo in the folder you choose to, i usually do it in the documents folder
- Install ohmyzsh from [their GH repo](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) or with their CURL method.
- to install the brew packages described in the brewfile use ```brew bundle``` while on the project repo and with Brew installed
- Create symlinks of the different config folders here to the actual config folder with ```ln -s thisFolder targetFolder```
- Open Tmux and install plugins (prefix + I)

## Notes
- Neovim configuration was created using [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and [TJ's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o&t=684s) and many other resources in the internet.

## ToDo
- Write script that will handle running whatever is needed to configure a new/ recently formatted Mac.
